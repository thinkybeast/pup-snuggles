# Pup Snuggles App

Pup Snuggles is a fun app that shows you dogs in your area in need of Snuggles! The app is built using Gatsby, and uses Gatsby Functions to retrieve the data from a remote source using an API key.

However, there seems to be a problem with the app!

An engineer recently merged some changes, and now it appears that the app is having some problems. When you run the app, the 'Loading' spinner continues to run.

Walk through the app, determine what the error(s) are, and update the code to get the app running again. These pups need snuggles!

## To get started:

- From the root directory, `npm i` to install dependencies
- Create a `.env.development` file in the root directory. We will provide you with an API key to use during the exercise
- `npm start` to start the app in develop mode.
